Circadian rhythm is an important mechanism that controls behavior and biochemical events based on
24 h rhythmicity. Ample evidence indicates disturbance of this mechanism is associated with diferent
diseases such as cancer, mood disorders, and familial delayed phase sleep disorder. Therefore, drug
discovery studies have been initiated using high throughput screening. Recently the crystal structures
of core clock proteins (CLOCK/BMAL1, Cryptochromes (CRY), Periods), responsible for generating
circadian rhythm, have been solved. Availability of structures makes amenable core clock proteins
to design molecules regulating their activity by using in silico approaches. In addition to that, the
implementation of classifcation features of molecules based on their toxicity and activity will improve
the accuracy of the drug discovery process. Here, we identifed 171 molecules that target functional
domains of a core clock protein, CRY1, using structure-based drug design methods. We experimentally
determined that 115 molecules were nontoxic, and 21 molecules signifcantly lengthened the period
of circadian rhythm in U2OS cells. We then performed a machine learning study to classify these
molecules for identifying features that make them toxic and lengthen the circadian period. Decision
tree classifers (DTC) identifed 13 molecular descriptors, which predict the toxicity of molecules
with a mean accuracy of 79.53% using tenfold cross-validation. Gradient boosting classifers (XGBC)
identifed 10 molecular descriptors that predict and increase in the circadian period length with a mean
accuracy of 86.56% with tenfold cross-validation. Our results suggested that these features can be
used in QSAR studies to design novel nontoxic molecules that exhibit period lengthening activity.

The selected final 10 features includes: "ATSC8c, MATS1e, minsCH3, MATS4e, MATS4s, ATSC7i, SpMin4_Bhp, MLFER_S, ATSC4p, SpMax2_Bhm"
